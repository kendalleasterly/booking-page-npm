Things to put in booking mode:

createEvent
decidePreviousStep (whn you call it in back button call the )
what the product id is


When you are calling your SIGNULAR HOOK, pass in the mode as a 
true false in the first parameter. write 

declare the functions hook in the regular place, then soon after do an if 
statemnt: if model has a value, give the variable the booking hook,
if not, give it the products hook. Have ALL the functions be the same
place, and do similar things.

when you are creaeting the hook for the products, pass in the useParams,
but ONLY do that if you can't access them within the hook
